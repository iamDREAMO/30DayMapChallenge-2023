The output for the challenge was to visualize the Lakes in the world (POLYGONS) both as an interactive web map and a paper formats. Both turned out to be good but I like the web map!üòç

The map shows the cities of the countries on the continent, Asia. By far, it was difficult in accessing data for this work. I am opened to sharing of links resources in the comments.

Tools: Everything was done in QGIS.

# Day-7: NAVIGATION

# Title: Flight-flow from ACC to neighbouring countries

![Day7-Navigation](https://github.com/iamDREAMO/My-30DayMapChallenge2023/assets/89151426/90773219-477e-4f1a-ae33-e996e66e3472)

Straight destination flights are mostly the wish for travelers embarking long journeys. Layovers can be tiring and boring at times. Kotoka International Airport is the only international airport currently in Ghana. Below is a visualization of flight flow from ACC (airport code for Kotoka International Airport) to airports, airfields, and helipads of neighboring countries.

# Day 9: HEXAGONS
# Title: Elevation of Lesotho

![3D-Lestho-Day9-Benedict-Kofi-Amofah](https://github.com/iamDREAMO/30DayMapChallenge-2023/assets/89151426/7fe832e0-8f4d-4273-838b-0289a234521f)

That's why it was a challenge! Hexagons visualization was new to me but I struggled and did it. I spent time to learn this and that also led me to start my visualization with Blender software. Yes, my first blender work combined with QGIS.

Tools:
* QGIS for hexagons
* DEM of Lesotho was combined with the hexagon layer to form the 3D elevation model in Blender
