Straight destination flights are mostly the wish for travelers embarking long journeys. Layovers can be tiring and boring at times. Kotoka International Airport is the only international airport currently in Ghana. Below is a visualization of flight flow from ACC (airport code for Kotoka International Airport) to airports, airfields, and helipads of neighboring countries.

That's why it was a challenge! Hexagons visualization was new to me but I struggled and did it. I spent time to learn this and that also led me to start my visualization with Blender software. Yes, my first blender work combined with QGIS.

Tools:
* QGIS for hexagons
* DEM of Lesotho was combined with the hexagon layer to form the 3D elevation model in Blender

The map shows the Hong Kong Population Distribution by Usual Spoken Language by 18 districts in 2021. It is a subset of the 2021 Population Census made available by the Census and Statistics Department under the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the "Government") at https://portal.csdi.gov.hk ("CSDI Portal").

# Day 14: EUROPE
# Title: Roads - National 250k Map Of Ireland

![Ireland_Roads_Day_14](https://github.com/iamDREAMO/30DayMapChallenge-2023/assets/89151426/7e12d13c-8b7c-4a26-994b-50b86c19ac4e)
Ireland was chosen for the theme (Europe) of the 2023 #30daymapchallenge and it is the second-largest island of the British Isles, and the third-largest in Europe.
The map features European roads (E-roads) and connections between built-up areas. In addition to main routes, it includes roads necessary for a fully connected transportation network, such as direct links between areas or routes to isolated places like harbors and airports. Within built-up areas, the map focuses on main roads, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation.

All roads are depicted with a single line, regardless of their size or number of lanes. 
This dataset is made available by Tailte √âireann.

# Day 15: OpenStreetMap
# Title: Venice, Italy OSM

Throughout the 2023 #30daymapchallenge, I encountered various OSM maps and likely explored most of the methods for acquiring data from sites supported by OSM. I became interested in automating this workflow to obtain a similar map for the challenge theme. I came across Prettymaps, a #Python package for drawing maps with customizable styles using OpenStreetMap data crated by Marcelo de Oliveira Rosa Prates. It is created using the osmnx, matplotlib, shapely, and vsketch packages. The documentation on GitHub provided a smooth experience, outlining the various steps to create and customize OSMs.

I also discovered the webapp version (Prettymap) developed by Christoph Rieke which has improved features on speed and adapted configuration to interface with the webapp.

# Day 17: FLOW
# Title: International Students in United States place of Origin from West Africa, 2022/2023

The concept of flow under the 2023 ##30daymapchallenge was geared towards flow of transport and people. I picked on the flow of people and the next step was data sourcing. 
Visiting the Open Doors Data organization website revealed a whole set of data. The decision was to visualize the flow of international students from the West Africa Sub-Saharan countries studying in the USA

Conditions of the atmosphere either weather or climate were the details for the 2023 #30daymapchallenge Day 18 under the Atmosphere theme. I used Climate Engine for my project during my undergraduate studies and it is an excellent tool with supportive data for analysis and visualization of satellite data in areas of Remote Sensing, Climate, Hydrology and among others.

"Climate Engine tools use Google Earth Engine for on-demand processing of satellite and climate data on a web browser and features on-demand mapping of environmental monitoring datasets, such as remote sensing and gridded meteorological observations."

Mount Kilimanjaro, situated in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania, is a dormant volcano characterized by three distinct volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. As the tallest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing peak above sea level globally, it reaches an impressive elevation of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level, towering approximately 4,900 meters (16,100 feet) above its plateau base. This volcanic giant holds the distinction of being the highest volcano not only in Africa but also in the Eastern Hemisphere.

This visualization was created from the NIWA's bathymetry model of New Zealand. With a 250m as the original resolution, I clipped out portions of the model to focus mainly on New Zealand. 
This represents a significant advancement in our understanding of New Zealand's underwater landscape.
Compiled from various sources including coastal charts, digital soundings archive, and multibeam data from both national and international surveys, this model is a comprehensive representation of the underwater terrain- NIWA Geospatial Data
