# Day-7: NAVIGATION

# Title: Flight-flow from ACC to neighbouring countries

![Day7-Navigation](https://github.com/iamDREAMO/My-30DayMapChallenge2023/assets/89151426/90773219-477e-4f1a-ae33-e996e66e3472)

Straight destination flights are mostly the wish for travelers embarking long journeys. Layovers can be tiring and boring at times. Kotoka International Airport is the only international airport currently in Ghana. Below is a visualization of flight flow from ACC (airport code for Kotoka International Airport) to airports, airfields, and helipads of neighboring countries.

# Day 9: HEXAGONS
# Title: Elevation of Lesotho

![3D-Lestho-Day9-Benedict-Kofi-Amofah](https://github.com/iamDREAMO/30DayMapChallenge-2023/assets/89151426/7fe832e0-8f4d-4273-838b-0289a234521f)

That's why it was a challenge! Hexagons visualization was new to me but I struggled and did it. I spent time to learn this and that also led me to start my visualization with Blender software. Yes, my first blender work combined with QGIS.

Tools:
* QGIS for hexagons
* DEM of Lesotho was combined with the hexagon layer to form the 3D elevation model in Blender

Inspired by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america), this map was recreated to show the 50 Level II ecological regions that have been delineated and intended to provide a more detailed description of the large ecological areas nested within the Level I regions. Level II ecological regions are useful for national and subcontinental overviews of ecological patterns.

# Day 11: RETRO	(A blast from the past)
# Title: Soil Suitability Map for Mechanised and other Cultivation Practices in Ghana

This map, Soil Suitability Map for Mechanised and other Cultivation Practices in Ghana was produced and printed by the Surrvey Department, Accra, GHANA on May 1971. The original map was visualized into 3D using #Blender. Other details can be found from the attached images.

Between 1928 and 1940, the TCI Cartographic Office for the Italian Encyclopedia of Giovanni Treccani Institute published this map and was printed by the renowned Italian publisher, Antonio Vallardi-Milano.
The creater of this map is Guido Bonarelli, Italian geologist and paleontologist (1871-1951).

The plain map was georeferenced in QGIS, combined with the DEM and modelled in #Blender.

# Day 13: CHOROPLETH
# Title: Hong Kong Population Distribution

![Hong_Kong](https://github.com/iamDREAMO/30DayMapChallenge-2023/assets/89151426/9d32516f-ebad-4156-9f76-9c7d327456d4)
The map shows the Hong Kong Population Distribution by Usual Spoken Language by 18 districts in 2021. It is a subset of the 2021 Population Census made available by the Census and Statistics Department under the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the "Government") at https://portal.csdi.gov.hk ("CSDI Portal"). 

I recreated the map with a focus on the population of each of the districts.

# Day 14: EUROPE
# Title: Roads - National 250k Map Of Ireland

![Ireland_Roads_Day_14](https://github.com/iamDREAMO/30DayMapChallenge-2023/assets/89151426/7e12d13c-8b7c-4a26-994b-50b86c19ac4e)
Ireland was chosen for the theme (Europe) of the 2023 #30daymapchallenge and it is the second-largest island of the British Isles, and the third-largest in Europe.
The map features European roads (E-roads) and connections between built-up areas. In addition to main routes, it includes roads necessary for a fully connected transportation network, such as direct links between areas or routes to isolated places like harbors and airports. Within built-up areas, the map focuses on main roads, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation.

All roads are depicted with a single line, regardless of their size or number of lanes. 
This dataset is made available by Tailte √âireann.

# Day 15: OpenStreetMap
# Title: Venice, Italy OSM

![Vernice Italy_Map](https://github.com/iamDREAMO/30DayMapChallenge-2023/assets/89151426/8cd7124a-c56d-4048-a5a7-a8d53ed1b5b9)
Throughout the 2023 #30daymapchallenge, I encountered various OSM maps and likely explored most of the methods for acquiring data from sites supported by OSM. I became interested in automating this workflow to obtain a similar map for the challenge theme. I came across Prettymaps, a #Python package for drawing maps with customizable styles using OpenStreetMap data crated by Marcelo de Oliveira Rosa Prates. It is created using the osmnx, matplotlib, shapely, and vsketch packages. The documentation on GitHub provided a smooth experience, outlining the various steps to create and customize OSMs.

I also discovered the webapp version (Prettymap) developed by Christoph Rieke which has improved features on speed and adapted configuration to interface with the webapp.
